****  This web page is using Bootstrap to help with the responsiveness. 
This is my second homework assignment given to us by Technology de Monterrey Mexico Coding. 


Picture Example Given:


![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67298961/95285808-4c31a200-0827-11eb-9dfd-61d6a0f8786b.JPG)



## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive 
layout.

### Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.



**** I pulled the work from the Tech Monterrey Gitlab and I then created my own repository for the project. I Created my assets folder and my image folder. 
Within my assets folder, I added my Html files and my CSS files to have things in order.

 ****  I started by Going to Bootstrap and finding a good Navbar to use and of my liking, making sure its also responsive on a mobile device. This NavBar will be on all the Html pages as this will navigate the end-users to the corresponding web page. I was not able to find one of my likings and so I cut and modified the code to my personal preference. 
I then started by seeing the layout provided in the pre-work assignments. ( see the image of the cat portfolio).
I used containers rows and culms to help with the positioning layout of the web page and to make the web page more mobile responsive.  Checking to see how it would look in each window size. Making sure throughout each change of each process the web worked great without any errors before committing to the change. 
I linked all tabs in the Navbar with the correct page it belongs to ( As the Html page is in another folder ) and clicking on the same page brings you back to the same page.

I felt that the about page was a bit empty and so I added my Social linked to my profile
**Linkedin 
**GitHub
**StackOverflow
I set this in a container with a row and a column. Making sure that the link opens up a new page. 
Unlike the Nav links. The Nav links take you directly to the dedicated page. 
The NavBar collapse into a hamburger menu and when pressed the dropped down menu populates and functioning well as the extended Navbar.

For the Portfolio page I added my job images that I held in the past with some certification. 
alt= with a description for the image for blind users as this will be read to them.
The imageÂ´s have a class="img-fluid img-thumbnail col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-sm-6" to help with the responsiveness

I then added linked the input information provided by the end-user page with a google sheet as a felt this should be done to get the information in a doc. 
This process took me a long time as there was no correct tutorial that worked I ended up grabbing code from three different information paged till I was able to link it and get 
the information to a Google sheet

****  In conclusion, I used columns and rows to help with the layout. NO errors came up and the web page is working and functioning well. It takes to each page and to the 
corresponding web sit liked to it. To top it off the contact page works with Google sheets and I'm able to get the input that the end-users send.
